# _JavaScript_
## _How JavaScript Works?_
 _**- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution Context`**_

## _Execution Context_
### _Execution Context has two Components_
- **_Memory:_** The place where all the variables and functions are stored as (key:value) pairs. Memory component is also known as **_Variable Environment_**
- **_Code:_** The place where code is executed one line at a time. Code Component is also known as **_Thread of Execution_**

### _Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous?_ & _Is JavaScript Single Threaded or Multi-Threaded?_
# **_JavaScript is a `Synchronous Single-Threaded Language`_**

- **_Single-Threaded:_** It means JavaScript can only execute `one command at a time`
- **_Synchronous Single-Threaded:_** It means executing one command at a time in a `specific order`
