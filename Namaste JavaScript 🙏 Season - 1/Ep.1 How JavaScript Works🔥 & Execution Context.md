# _JavaScript_

**Definition:**<br>
> "JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented scripting language used primarily to add interactivity and dynamic features to web pages. It can also be used for server-side development with Node.js and building other applications."

**Uses:** <br>
> "JavaScript is essential for front-end web development, enabling interactive user interfaces, animations, form validation, and real-time updates without page reloads. With Node.js, it's used for server-side development, building web and mobile applications, and even game development."

**Advantages:** <br>
- **Client-Side Execution:** Code runs directly in the user's browser, reducing server load and improving speed. <br>
- **Ease of Use & Versatility:** It's relatively easy to learn and integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS, making it highly adaptable for various applications. <br>
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Provides a vast collection of libraries and frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js) that simplify development and offer pre-built components for efficient and dynamic applications. <br>
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Its model allows tasks to run independently, enhancing application responsiveness and performance.

## _How JavaScript Works?_
 _**- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution Context`**_


## _Execution Context_
### _Execution Context has two Components_
- **_Memory:_** The place where all the variables and functions are stored as (key:value) pairs. Memory component is also known as **_Variable Environment_**
- **_Code:_** The place where code is executed one line at a time. Code Component is also known as **_Thread of Execution_**

### _Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous?_ & _Is JavaScript Single Threaded or Multi-Threaded?_
# **_"JavaScript is a `Synchronous Single-Threaded Language`"_**

- **_Single-Threaded:_** It means JavaScript can only execute `one command at a time`
- **_Synchronous Single-Threaded:_** It means executing one command at a time in a `specific order`
