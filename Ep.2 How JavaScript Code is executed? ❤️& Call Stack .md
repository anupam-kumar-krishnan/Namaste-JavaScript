## _What happens when you run JavaScript code?_
- An **`Execution Context`** is **_created_**

### _Execution Context is created in Two phases:_
 _**1. Memory Creation Phase:**_ In this phase, JavaScript runs through the program & allocates memory to all variables & functions. JavaScript swims throught the whole code and allocate a special value **`undefined`**<br>
 _**2. Code Execution Phase:**_ In this phase, each line is executed line by line


Let's take an example:

- Once JavaScript is done with all it's work, the program is finished.
- Now, the whole **`Global Execution Context`** also gets deleted
- This is too much for JavaScript Engine to handle.  To handle this creation & deletion of Execution Context, it manages a stack known as **_Call Stack_**

## _Call Stack_
- Everytime, at the bottom of the stack, we have our `Global Execution Context`
- Whenever any Javascript code is run, this call stack is populated with the Global Execution Context
- Whenever a new Execution Context is created, it is pushed inside the stack

### _Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts_

## _Call stack is also known by below names_
_**0. Call Stack**_ <br>
_**1. Execution Context Stack**_ <br>
_**2. Program Stack**_ <br>
_**3. Control Stack**_ <br>
_**4. Runtime Stack**_ <br>
_**5. Machine Stack**_ <br>
