# _JavaScript_
## _Compiler_
- Compilers already have a **understanding** of syntax used by a **programming language**

- Earlier, to compile JavaScript, we need to make a HTML file and a JS file. Then we add the JS file to HTML by a script tag. As we all know, before compiler used to compiler JavaScript were inbuilt in Browsers.

- But nowdays, that compiler has been segregated and become a standalone software i.e. **_Node.js_**

- The **compiler** used for _compiling_ JavaScript Code is _**Node JS**_

- There is **another compiler** available for JavaScript named as _**Deno JS**_

- Both _**Node JS**_ and _**Deno JS**_ are founded _**Ryan Dahl**_

- Mostly _**Node JS**_ is used for _**JavaScript**_

- If we are working on a production grade application, then we will used Long Term Support(LTS) version, otherwise we will use Current stable version.
