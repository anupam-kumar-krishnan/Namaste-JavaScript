# _JavaScript_
## _How JavaScript Works?_
 _**- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution Context`**_

## _Execution Context_
### _Execution Context has two Components_
- **_Memory:_** It consists of Variables & Functions in **`Key Value Pairs`**. It is also called **`Variable Environment`**
- **_Code:_** This is the place where the code executes line by line. It is also called **`Thread of Execution.`**

## _Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous?_ & _Is JavaScript Single Threaded or Multi-Threaded?_
**_- JavaScript is a `Synchronous Single-Threaded Language`_**

- **_Single-Threaded:_** It means JavaScript can only execute only `one command at a time`
- **_Synchronous:_** It means execution one command at a time in a `specific order`
